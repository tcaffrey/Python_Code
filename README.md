### 1. Classification of Online Shoppers intention
Based on the Kaggle data set uploaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/roshansharma/online-shoppers-intention) <br/> <br/>

This is an example of building a binary classification solution and tuning a variety of different models. <br/>
A binary classification problem that looks to model if an online shopper will make a purchase or not based on some online bahviours. A variety of classification models are tested (Logisitc Regression, SVM, RF and Xgboost for example).  <br/> <br/>
91% validation accuracy and 0.68 F1 score achieved, which is higher than found on any other uploads on the Kaggle website. 

### 2. Predicting Future Sales
Based on the Kaggle challenge [Predicting Future Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/overview). This is an example of a regression problem, with heavy use of manipulating data to create features. <br/> <br/>
A rank of 2416 / 6284 (at time of submission) with an RMSE value of 0.96224 was achieved, with an Xgboost model. Due to the size of the dataset I wasn't able to run a model using the full datset on my laptop so believe with the full dataset I could achieve a better score.
